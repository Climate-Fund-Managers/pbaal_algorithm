The innovation involves demonstrating that industrial waste water treatment can be energy positive, can contribute to low carbon growth, and through the innovative financial and ownership structuring, involving beneficiary firms, further demonstrate that waste water treatment could be a viable local business proposition in Jordan, if climate finance can be used to reduce policy, capacity and regulatory barriers. Proving the business case would also then open the way for self replicating model of low carbon growth in Jordan and perhaps the region based on local private sector investment.

Rural inhabitants are paying more than double the price they use to pay costal areas groundwater sources are threatened with seawater intrusion. So far, no projects have been implemented whose main objective is to enhance ground water volumes as coping mechanizes strategies have not been effective. In Eritrea, about one million cubic meters of water flow out of the country as surface flow.
