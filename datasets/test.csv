The energy produced by the NAMA would go towards meeting the renewable energy requirements set out in the Renewable energy and energy efficiency law, National Electric Power Company (NEPCO), which will be responsible for the grid connection, The Water Authority of Jordan, which manages permitting of waste water, The Ministry of Agriculture, which issues the necessary approvals for the sale of soil improver and water for irrigation, Jordan Investment Board JIB), which is set to play a central role in PPP development under the draft PPP law and Zarqa Chamber of Industry and its members, which is interested in the provision of a waste water treatment service to help with their environmental compliance The IWWTE NAMA represents a significant departure from the business as usual case for Jordan. The innovation involves demonstrating that industrial waste water treatment can be energy positive, can contribute to low carbon growth, and through the innovative financial and ownership structuring, involving beneficiary firms, further demonstrate that waste water treatment could be a viable local business proposition in Jordan, if climate finance can be used to reduce policy, capacity and regulatory barriers. Proving the business case would also then open the way for self replicating model of low carbon growth in Jordan and perhaps the region based on local private sector investment.

The wells are drying up and the population in some villages are walking long distance to fetch water. Small holder irrigated agriculture from ground water is failing examples are like in Alla and Hagaz are depending on water tracking. Rural inhabitants are paying more than double the price they use to pay costal areas groundwater sources are threatened with seawater intrusion. So far, no projects have been implemented whose main objective is to enhance ground water volumes as coping mechanizes strategies have not been effective. In Eritrea, about one million cubic meters of water flow out of the country as surface flow. If a substantial amount of this water is allowed to be stored in under ground aquifer as ground water, this will enable communities and livelihood resource to better adapt to the negative impact of climate changes.
