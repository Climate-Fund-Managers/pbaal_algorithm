The previous dumpsites that were closed off also need to be considered for methane collection and flaring system. These are the Point Ronde and Stockfarm dumpsites which were closed when the new site was commissioned. In order to further reduce methane emissions and reach our target, the present volume of organic waste brought into the landfill (40 of all waste) has to be reduced.

Municipal and industrial solid waste management (including hazardous and toxic waste),"The national strategy for solid waste management is failing because environmental management is not mainstreamed into local development plans and weak resource mobilization, due to the lack of fiscal decentralization and lack of participatory approach to the decentralization process. Waste management receives less than NUMBER of urban council budgets compared to other policy areas. In conclusion, for effective waste management there is need for genuine decentralization where urban councils are empowered, have capacity for resource mobilization and apply participatory planning.",entailment,2785

Solid waste to electricity generation,"A successful feasibility study for a 1.2 mw waste-to-energy (wte) plant in majuro was conducted in NUMBER WTE would substantially reduce RMIs waste-related emissions thanks to the reduction of methane emissions. Furthermore, a WTE plant could provide baseload power for RMI, at least partially eliminating the short to medium-term need for diesel-powered electricity generation.
