This project will abate most of this methane by: (a) diverting organics from the waste stream that is currently deposited in the landfill; and (b) suitably preparing the landfill, and installing a flaring system. In addition, the present landfill needs to be expanded if it is expected to receive more waste within the next NUMBER years. The previous dumpsites that were closed off also need to be considered for methane collection and flaring system. These are the Point Ronde and Stockfarm dumpsites which were closed when the new site was commissioned. In order to further reduce methane emissions and reach our target, the present volume of organic waste brought into the landfill (40 of all waste) has to be reduced. This can be done by implementing a fully integrated solid waste management program that involves the following: i) Public awareness and extension program throughout the island; ) Curbside pickup of organic waste (separation from source with revised collection system); ) Curbside pickup of individual types of non-organic waste (separation from source with revised collection system); ) Material recovery facilities and composting facilities in selected regions on the island.",1,2181

This project will abate most of this methane by: (a) diverting organics from the waste stream that is currently deposited in the landfill; and (b) suitably preparing the landfill, and installing a flaring system.

The previous dumpsites that were closed off also need to be considered for methane collection and flaring system. These are the Point Ronde and Stockfarm dumpsites which were closed when the new site was commissioned. In order to further reduce methane emissions and reach our target, the present volume of organic waste brought into the landfill (40 of all waste) has to be reduced.

Solar water purification systems integrate solar electricity and water purification. Solar panels generate power for a battery that pumps the water through a filtration and purification system. A large water unit can produce litres of purified waterhour, while the small unit provides 50-70 litres of waterday.

Small holder irrigated agriculture from ground water is failing examples are like in Alla and Hagaz are depending on water tracking. Rural inhabitants are paying more than double the price they use to pay costal areas groundwater sources are threatened with seawater intrusion. So far, no projects have been implemented whose main objective is to enhance ground water volumes as coping mechanizes strategies have not been effective. In Eritrea, about one million cubic meters of water flow out of the country as surface flow.

Aquaculture,"Baseline information: currently there are no projects focused on eco-friendly integrated aquaculture systems using a variety of marine, brackish and freshwater species including mudcrab, shrimp, clam and fish species (e.g. Tilapia) within the coastal zone. However, there has been rapid growth of unsustainable marine shrimp culture throughout the region, resulting in large-scale clearing of mangroves, conversion of agricultural lands to shrimp ponds, pumping of seawater into freshwater areas (leading to salinisation of soils and groundwater), extraction of ground water and discharge of pollution and pond effluents. This has lead to severe environmental degradation as well as social conflicts between shrimp farmers, other land users and water users. At present, there are often no legal requirements for EIAs (Environmental Impact Assessments) for implementing shrimp farming in coastal areas. In cases where legal standards exist, the EIA is not effective. This is because there are no clear guidelines for eco-friendly aquaculture systems.",1,399

Ground-water abstraction,"Rationale: urban and rural communities, irrigated agriculture and industries who rely on ground water resources for their water supply are already suffering from the negative impact of climate ariability in particular low and unreliable rainfall, short rainy season, extreme weather events such as drought and climate change. The wells are drying up and the population in some villages are walking long distance to fetch water. Small holder irrigated agriculture from ground water is failing examples are like in Alla and Hagaz are depending on water tracking. Rural inhabitants are paying more than double the price they use to pay costal areas groundwater sources are threatened with seawater intrusion. So far, no projects have been implemented whose main objective is to enhance ground water volumes as coping mechanizes strategies have not been effective. In Eritrea, about one million cubic meters of water flow out of the country as surface flow. If a substantial amount of this water is allowed to be stored in under ground aquifer as ground water, this will enable communities and livelihood resource to better adapt to the negative impact of climate changes. To cope with this problem and sustain the resource activities to enhance groundwater recharging will be required.",-1,1979
