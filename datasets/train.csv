This project will abate most of this methane by: (a) diverting organics from the waste stream that is currently deposited in the landfill; and (b) suitably preparing the landfill, and installing a flaring system. In addition, the present landfill needs to be expanded if it is expected to receive more waste within the next NUMBER years. The previous dumpsites that were closed off also need to be considered for methane collection and flaring system. These are the Point Ronde and Stockfarm dumpsites which were closed when the new site was commissioned. In order to further reduce methane emissions and reach our target, the present volume of organic waste brought into the landfill (40 of all waste) has to be reduced. This can be done by implementing a fully integrated solid waste management program that involves the following: i) Public awareness and extension program throughout the island; ) Curbside pickup of organic waste (separation from source with revised collection system); ) Curbside pickup of individual types of non-organic waste (separation from source with revised collection system); ) Material recovery facilities and composting facilities in selected regions on the island.",1,67

Methane collection vents were installed from the start, and have been venting the methane produced from the organic waste decomposition process ever since. This project will abate most of this methane by: (a) diverting organics from the waste stream that is currently deposited in the landfill; and (b) suitably preparing the landfill, and installing a flaring system. In addition, the present landfill needs to be expanded if it is expected to receive more waste within the next NUMBER years. The previous dumpsites that were closed off also need to be considered for methane collection and flaring system. These are the Point Ronde and Stockfarm dumpsites which were closed when the new site was commissioned. In order to further reduce methane emissions and reach our target, the present volume of organic waste brought into the landfill (40 of all waste) has to be reduced. This can be done by implementing a fully integrated solid waste management program that involves the following: i) Public awareness and extension program throughout the island; ) Curbside pickup of organic waste (separation from source with revised collection system); ) Curbside pickup of individual types of non-organic waste (separation from source with revised collection system); ) Material recovery facilities and composting facilities in selected regions on the island.",0,820

Small holder irrigated agriculture from ground water is failing examples are like in Alla and Hagaz are depending on water tracking. Rural inhabitants are paying more than double the price they use to pay costal areas groundwater sources are threatened with seawater intrusion. So far, no projects have been implemented whose main objective is to enhance ground water volumes as coping mechanizes strategies have not been effective. In Eritrea, about one million cubic meters of water flow out of the country as surface flow. If a substantial amount of this water is allowed to be stored in under ground aquifer as ground water, this will enable communities and livelihood resource to better adapt to the negative impact of climate changes.

The wells are drying up and the population in some villages are walking long distance to fetch water. Small holder irrigated agriculture from ground water is failing examples are like in Alla and Hagaz are depending on water tracking. Rural inhabitants are paying more than double the price they use to pay costal areas groundwater sources are threatened with seawater intrusion. So far, no projects have been implemented whose main objective is to enhance ground water volumes as coping mechanizes strategies have not been effective. In Eritrea, about one million cubic meters of water flow out of the country as surface flow. If a substantial amount of this water is allowed to be stored in under ground aquifer as ground water, this will enable communities and livelihood resource to better adapt to the negative impact of climate changes.

The communications climate change and vulnerability assessment state the following on historical precipitation trends.,It is concluded with low confidence that there wasnt an obvious trend in the rate of precipitation change during the period 1901-2016,1,3450
The communications climate change and vulnerability assessment state the following on projected climate change,It is predicted with a high degree of certainty that Namibia can expect an increase in temperature at all localities,1,3451
The communications climate change and vulnerability assessment state the following on projected climate change,"It is projected that the mean annual temperature will increase by 2oC and 4oC relative to the baseline (1981-2018) by mid-century and end-century respectively, under the worst-case scenario",1,3452
The communications climate change and vulnerability assessment state the following on projected climate change,"the majority of the 35 [Global Climate Models] predict that Namibia will become drier, that rainfall variability will likely increase, and that extreme events such as droughts and floods are likely to become more frequent and intense",1,3453
The communications climate change and vulnerability assessment state the following on risks and vulnerabilities,"Specifically, the projection maps indicate a reduction of precipitation in the Karas Region",1,3454
The communications climate change and vulnerability assessment state the following on projected climate change,"The Namibian coastline, on the Atlantic Ocean, is approximately 1,200 km long and consists of 78% sandy beaches, 16% rocky shores and 4% mixed sand and rocky shores. Lagoons back only 2% of the shore. There are four significant towns on the coast: Lderitz, Walvis Bay (the only deep-water port), Swakopmund and Henties Bay. Given the lack of natural and human-made protective infrastructure to storm surges, the coastal areas are highly vulnerable to sea-level rise",1,3455
The communications climate change and vulnerability assessment state the following on projected climate change,The most significant drivers of climate change risks and vulnerability that are of importance to coastal environments and fisheries are: modification of terrestrial climatic and hydrologic processes; change in coastal and oceanic circulation processes; ocean acidification; increased sea surface temperature; sea level rise; increase in sea storminess; and changing wind systems,1,3456
