This project will abate most of this methane by: (a) diverting organics from the waste stream that is currently deposited in the landfill; and (b) suitably preparing the landfill, and installing a flaring system. In addition, the present landfill needs to be expanded if it is expected to receive more waste within the next NUMBER years. The previous dumpsites that were closed off also need to be considered for methane collection and flaring system. These are the Point Ronde and Stockfarm dumpsites which were closed when the new site was commissioned. In order to further reduce methane emissions and reach our target, the present volume of organic waste brought into the landfill (40 of all waste) has to be reduced. This can be done by implementing a fully integrated solid waste management program that involves the following: i) Public awareness and extension program throughout the island; ) Curbside pickup of organic waste (separation from source with revised collection system); ) Curbside pickup of individual types of non-organic waste (separation from source with revised collection system); ) Material recovery facilities and composting facilities in selected regions on the island.",1,2181

3842,Solid waste to electricity generation,"A successful feasibility study for a 1.2 mw waste-to-energy (wte) plant in majuro was conducted in NUMBER WTE would substantially reduce RMIs waste-related emissions thanks to the reduction of methane emissions. Furthermore, a WTE plant could provide baseload power for RMI, at least partially eliminating the short to medium-term need for diesel-powered electricity generation. This would provide the dual benefit of reducing waste as well as decreasing the need for imported fossil fuel.",1,3842
